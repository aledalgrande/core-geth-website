# How to setup an Ethereum node on Raspberry Pi

## Introduction

Raspberry Pi is a simple, small, and affordable single board computer that can be used to run a local Ethereum node. While many users operate nodes with cloud service providers this can be expensive overtime, especially for full nodes of the mainnet, but Raspberry Pi's simplicity has a low barrier to entry to get started with a local node. Raspberry Pi, and other single board computers, consume far less energy than a tradtional server or desktop machine and a Raspberry Pi's storage can be expanded through external hard drive solutions; NAS, RAID, and other external storage.

## What you'll learn

- Setup a Rasberry Pi 4 Model B with Ubuntu-LTS & Core-geth
- Run Core-geth to provide the ETC, ETH, or related test networks.
